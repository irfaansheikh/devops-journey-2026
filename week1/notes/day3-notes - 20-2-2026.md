# Week 1 - Day 3 Notes

✅ Week 1 – Day 3
⚙️ Processes, System Monitoring & Background Jobs

Now you move from file-level Linux to system-level Linux.

This is where DevOps actually starts.

🎯 Outcome of Today

After today you should:

Understand what a process is

Monitor running processes

Kill processes safely

Run jobs in background

Understand CPU & memory usage

Use basic system monitoring tools

Think like someone managing production servers

🧠 Core Concept

Everything running on Linux = a process

Docker container? → Process
Nginx? → Process
Kubernetes pod? → Process group

If you can’t control processes, you can’t control servers.

🛠 Practical Labs (Inside linux-labs/process-lab)
1️⃣ Create Lab Folder
mkdir process-lab
cd process-lab

2️⃣ View Running Processes
ps
ps aux


Understand columns:

USER

PID

%CPU

%MEM

Now try:

top


Press:

q to quit

If installed, also try:

htop


(If not installed, skip for now.)

3️⃣ Create a Dummy Running Process

Run:

sleep 300


It will freeze terminal for 5 minutes.

Open another terminal and run:

ps aux | grep sleep


Find PID.

Kill it:

kill <PID>


Check again — it should be gone.

4️⃣ Background Jobs

Run:

sleep 200 &


Notice:

It returns control immediately

Shows job ID

Check jobs:

jobs


Bring job to foreground:

fg


Stop it using:

CTRL + C

5️⃣ Kill by Name (Important)

Start another sleep:

sleep 500 &


Then:

pkill sleep


OR:

killall sleep


Production trick.

6️⃣ Check System Resources
free -h
df -h
uptime


Understand:

RAM usage

Disk usage

Load average

Load average is very important for servers.

🧠 Engineering Thinking Questions

What happens if a process consumes 100% CPU?

What happens if memory is full?

What is OOM killer?

Why do we monitor load average?

What happens if you kill the wrong process in production?

This is DevOps thinking.

# Day 3 – Processes & Monitoring

## Commands Practiced
- ps
- ps aux
- top
- kill
- pkill
- jobs
- fg
- free -h
- df -h
- uptime

## Key Learnings
- Every service runs as a process
- Background jobs using &
- Load average basics
- Process IDs (PID) matter

## Reflection
Controlling processes feels like controlling the server.

💾 Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Day 3 - Processes and Monitoring"
git push

🔥 Mental Upgrade

Today you moved from:

“I know Linux commands”

to

“I can manage a running system”
