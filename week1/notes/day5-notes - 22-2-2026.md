# Week 1 - Day 5 Notes

Excellent.
Planning ahead = engineering mindset.

You’ll do:

✅ Saturday → Day 4 (Networking)

✅ Sunday → Day 5 (Services & System Control)

Now here is Day 5 unlocked in advance so you’re ready.

✅ Week 1 – Day 5
🛠 Package Management + systemctl + Services

This is real server control.

If something breaks in production,
this is where you fix it.

🎯 Outcome of Today

After today you should:

Install & remove packages confidently

Understand service lifecycle

Start / stop / restart services

Enable services on boot

Understand what systemd is

Debug a failed service

This is essential for:

Nginx

Docker

Jenkins

SSH

Kubernetes

Everything runs as a service.

🧠 Core Concept First

Modern Ubuntu uses:

👉 systemd

It controls:

Services

Boot process

Background daemons

Command used:

systemctl

🛠 Practical Labs (Inside linux-labs/service-lab)
1️⃣ Create Folder
mkdir service-lab
cd service-lab

2️⃣ Package Management Basics

Update system:

sudo apt update


Upgrade packages:

sudo apt upgrade


Install nginx:

sudo apt install nginx


Check version:

nginx -v

3️⃣ Service Control

Check status:

sudo systemctl status nginx


Stop service:

sudo systemctl stop nginx


Check again — should be inactive.

Start:

sudo systemctl start nginx


Restart:

sudo systemctl restart nginx


Enable on boot:

sudo systemctl enable nginx


Disable:

sudo systemctl disable nginx

4️⃣ Verify Port 80
ss -tulnp | grep 80


Open browser:

http://localhost


You should see nginx default page.

You just deployed a production-grade web server locally.

5️⃣ View Logs (Very Important)
sudo journalctl -u nginx


This is how you debug failed services.

6️⃣ Remove Package
sudo apt remove nginx


Then verify port 80 closed.

🧠 Engineering Thinking Questions

What happens if nginx fails to start?

Where do logs help?

Why enable services at boot?

What if port 80 is already in use?

How would this work inside AWS EC2?

You’re now thinking infra-level.

# Day 5 – Services & Package Management

## Commands Practiced
- apt update
- apt install
- systemctl status
- systemctl start/stop/restart
- journalctl
- ss -tulnp

## Key Learnings
- systemd manages services
- Services can be enabled at boot
- Logs are critical for debugging
- Port conflicts matter

## Reflection
Now Linux feels like a real server, not just a terminal.

💾 Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Day 5 - Services and System Control"
git push

🔥 Week 1 Completion Status

After Day 5 you will have:

File system mastery

Permissions control

Process management

Networking basics

Service control

That’s a solid Linux foundation.

Next week we start:

👉 Bash scripting + deeper Linux
Then Docker enters properly.

You’re not rushing.
You’re building correctly.

Saturday → Day 4
Sunday → Day 5

Reply after each one is done.

No zero days.
