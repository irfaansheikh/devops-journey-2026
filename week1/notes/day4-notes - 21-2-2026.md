# Week 1 - Day 4 Notes

Good. You’re building momentum now.

Day 4 is where Linux connects to the real world.

✅ Week 1 – Day 4
🌐 Networking Basics (Ports, Connectivity, SSH)

This is critical for:

Docker

AWS

Security Groups

Kubernetes

CI/CD

Production debugging

If you don’t understand ports and networking, DevOps becomes guessing.

🎯 Outcome of Today

After today you should:

Understand what a port is

Know difference between localhost and public IP

Test connectivity

Inspect listening services

Understand SSH basics

Debug basic network issues

🧠 Core Concepts First
What is a Port?

Think:

IP = Building address

Port = Apartment number

Example:

192.168.1.10:22


22 = SSH
80 = HTTP
443 = HTTPS

🛠 Practical Labs (Inside linux-labs/network-lab)
1️⃣ Create Lab Folder
mkdir network-lab
cd network-lab

2️⃣ Check Your IP Address
ip a


Look for:

lo → localhost (127.0.0.1)

eth0 or wlan0 → actual network interface

Also run:

hostname -I

3️⃣ Test Connectivity
ping google.com


Stop with:

CTRL + C


Now test:

ping 8.8.8.8


Difference:

Domain test

Direct IP test

If domain fails but IP works → DNS issue.

This is real-world debugging.

4️⃣ Check Open Ports
ss -tulnp


OR

netstat -tulnp


Understand:

LISTEN

Port numbers

Associated process

5️⃣ Test HTTP Request
curl https://google.com


You’ll see raw HTML.

This is how DevOps tests APIs and services.

6️⃣ Install & Start Simple Web Server (Very Important)

Run:

python3 -m http.server 8000


Now open browser:

http://localhost:8000


You just hosted a web server locally.

Now in another terminal:

ss -tulnp | grep 8000


See the port open.

Stop server:

CTRL + C

7️⃣ SSH Basics

Check if SSH is running:

sudo systemctl status ssh


If not installed:

sudo apt install openssh-server


Start:

sudo systemctl start ssh


Check listening port:

ss -tulnp | grep 22


SSH to localhost:

ssh yourusername@localhost


Exit:

exit

🧠 Engineering Thinking Questions

What happens if port 22 is blocked?

Why does AWS use Security Groups?

What if Docker container port isn’t exposed?

Why does Kubernetes use NodePort and ClusterIP?

Why should SSH not be exposed publicly without restrictions?

This is infra thinking.
