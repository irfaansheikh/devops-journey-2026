# Week 1 - Day 2 Notes

Week 1 – Day 2
🔐 File Permissions + Users + Ownership

This is where Linux becomes real DevOps material.

If Day 1 removed fear of terminal,
Day 2 removes fear of access control.

🎯 Outcome of Today

After today you should:
Understand rwx
Read permission strings like -rwxr-xr--
Change permissions confidently
Understand user vs group vs others
Know ownership manipulation
Understand why permissions matter in production

🧠 Core Concept First

Run:
ls -l

You’ll see something like:

-rw-r--r-- 1 irfan irfan  120 Feb 18 file.txt


Break it down:

- rw- r-- r--
|  |   |   |
|  |   |   → Others
|  |   → Group
|  → User (Owner)
→ File type


r = read
w = write
x = execute

🛠 Practical Labs (Do In linux-labs Folder)
1️⃣ Create Test Environment
mkdir permissions-lab
cd permissions-lab
touch file1.sh
echo "echo Hello DevOps" > file1.sh


Check permissions:

ls -l

2️⃣ Make File Executable
chmod +x file1.sh

Run:
./file1.sh


Now check permissions again:
ls -l


You should see x added.
3️⃣ Numeric Permissions (Important)

Learn this table:
Number	Permission
4	Read
2	Write
1	Execute

Examples:

chmod 777 file1.sh
chmod 755 file1.sh
chmod 644 file1.sh


Understand what each does.

🔴 Important:
In real servers:

777 = bad practice

755 = common for scripts

644 = common for files

4️⃣ Ownership

Check owner:

ls -l


Change owner (if sudo access):

sudo chown root file1.sh


Change back:

sudo chown irfan file1.sh


Change group:

sudo chgrp irfan file1.sh

5️⃣ Create New User (Advanced Practice)
sudo adduser devopsuser


Switch user:

su - devopsuser


Try accessing file1.sh
Notice permission restrictions.

Switch back:

exit

🧠 Engineering Thinking Exercise

Ask yourself:

Why can’t random users modify /etc/passwd?

Why are scripts often 755?

Why shouldn’t we use 777 in production?

What happens if Kubernetes pod runs as non-root?

This thinking separates admin from engineer.
